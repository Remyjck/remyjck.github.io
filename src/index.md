As of October 2023, I am a PhD student at Inria Paris' [Cambium](https://cambium.inria.fr/) team, supervised by [François Pottier](https://cambium.inria.fr/~fpottier/).

My research interests are in programming languages, formal verification, and program semantics. Specifically, I am focused on giving mechanised formal semantics for OCaml, and providing a program logic for these semantics using [Iris](https://iris-project.org/).

> [!NOTE]
> As of 2025, I am working with [Son Ho](https://www.sonho.fr/) at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK.
> There, I am working on the formal verification of Rust programs.

# Education

- Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) (2019-2022)
- Master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-advanced-computer-science) (2022-2023)

# Research Visits

In 2022, I had the opportunity to work with Johannes Åman Pohjola at the [Trustworthy Systems](https://trustworthy.systems/) group hosted at UNSW Sydney, Australia.
There, I bootstrapped a verified compiler for [Pancake](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/pancake/) using CakeML's verified compilation toolchain.
