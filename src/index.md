I am a second-year PhD student at Inria Paris' [Cambium](https://cambium.inria.fr/) team, supervised by [François Pottier](https://cambium.inria.fr/~fpottier/).

My research interests are in programming languages, formal verification, and program semantics.

My current main project is to give mechanised formal semantics for
<img src="/img/ocaml-logo.svg" alt="Ocaml logo" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: text-top"> OCaml,
and to provide a program logic for these semantics using
[<img src="/img/iris-logo.svg" alt="Iris logo" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: sub"> Iris](https://iris-project).

# Education

- Master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-advanced-computer-science) (2022-2023)
- Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) (2019-2022)

# Research Visits

During the summer of 2025, I interned at
<img src="/img/microsoft-logo.svg" alt="Microsoft logo" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: text-top"> Microsoft Research
in Cambridge (UK) where I worked with [Son Ho](https://www.sonho.fr/) on the formal verification of unsafe Rust programs.

In 2022, I work as a research assistant with Johannes Åman Pohjola at the [Trustworthy Systems](https://trustworthy.systems/) group (home of seL4) hosted at UNSW Sydney, Australia.
There, I bootstrapped a verified compiler for [Pancake](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/pancake/) using CakeML's verified compilation toolchain.
